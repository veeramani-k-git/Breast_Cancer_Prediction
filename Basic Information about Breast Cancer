*Malignant and benign are two terms used to describe the behavior of tumors. 
   *A malignant tumor is a tumor that can grow and spread to other parts of the body. 
   *A benign tumor is a tumor that does not grow or spread.

*Malignant tumors are often called cancers. 
   *Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. 
   *Benign tumors are not cancerous. However, they can still cause problems if they grow large enough or press on important structures.

*The main difference between malignant and benign tumors is their potential to spread. 
   *Malignant tumors can spread through the bloodstream or lymphatic system to other parts of the body. 
   *Benign tumors do not spread.

*Another difference between malignant and benign tumors is their growth rate. 
   *Malignant tumors tend to grow more quickly than benign tumors.

*The treatment for malignant and benign tumors also differs. 
   *Malignant tumors are often treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. 
   *Benign tumors are often treated with surgery, but other treatments, such as watchful waiting, may also be used.
